    <p>In America today, many races are discriminated against. We mostly see african americans and hispanic peoples as the target of these crimes. People hate these immigrants for coming into america and "Stealing our culture, our land, and our money." But really Americans were some of the first immigrants to come to North America.Many of these races have made little to no threats on America and have not engaged us in any acts of war in the past 30-40 years. Yet we target them for expressing their Human rights. Below is a chart that shows the racial diversity of many countries found around the world.</p>

<p>As seen above, no country is the most diverse. Every country has an overwhelming population of some race. What counts is how that overwhelming race impacts the other populations.</p>
       <p> In Kenya the overwhelming population consists of many native tribes. Kenya has,among other things:</p>
       <li>Accepted Asians as its own tribe</li>
       <li>Given safe homes to refugees</li>
       <li>Allowed all people to speak their native language      </li><li>Allows expression of all religions</li>
       <p>In Russia, the population is overwhelmingly white. Russia has:</p>
       <li>Given African children free education</li>
       <li>Elected African counsil members</li>
      <p>In America, the overwhelming population is white.America is,however, one of the most diverse countries. America has</p>
      <li>Aloud immigrants to enter and file for citizenship      </li>
     <li>Accepted all religions</li>
     <li>given all people freedom of expression and writing      </li>
     <p>Many countries look at these lsts and think that their country is so great for doing these things. What most people don't see, or choose to ignore, is the things mainstream media chooses to ignore. For example;</p><p> Did you know that over 500 African Americans graduated from FAMU  this year? Or that Multiple African American FAMILIES are going into higher educations and careers? One family of 5 men are all going to college, 2 of them are studying to be dentists, 1 of them will be an engineer, and 2 of them will be nurses.Do you know that 11 women graduated Elon university of law? And that this year alone the youngest judge in pennsylvania is a 27 y/o African man? And 8 African women are making history, South Fulton is the FIRST city in American history where every criminal justice department head is an African American woman?</p>

     <p>All these things are not mentioned by mainstream media and many people will never know that these things even exist. Our president has not mentioned any achievments of African Americans but was "outraged" that WATER was thrown at a WHITE women. Not to mention that OUR PREVIOUS PRESIDENT WAS BLACK. </p>
